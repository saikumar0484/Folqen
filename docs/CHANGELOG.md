- Provider registry type foundation in `src/lib/providers.ts`.

- Expanded README setup instructions.
- Architecture, security, route map, provider, plugin, upgrade, and failure recovery docs.

### Changed

- Merged the newer `main` AGENTS.md update into `build/phase-0-foundation`.
- Replaced deprecated `next lint` script with `eslint .`.
- Removed unused homepage icon import.
- Kept neon green dark cyber/glass UI direction.

### Verification

- `npm install`: passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run test`: passed, 6 tests.
- `prisma validate`: passed with local development `DATABASE_URL`.
- `npm run build`: passed, 23 app routes generated.
- Dev server HTTP checks passed for `/`, `/dashboard`, and `/platforms`.

### Limitations

- In-app browser screenshot verification was unavailable due missing `agent-browser` CLI and browser-use Node runtime access denial.
- `npm audit` reports two moderate Next/PostCSS advisories; no safe automatic fix was applied.
