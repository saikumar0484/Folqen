# Handoff Log

## Current Phase

Phase 1 foundation verified. Phase 2 app shell and placeholder routes started.

## Branch

`build/phase-0-foundation`

## Completed Work

- Synced branch with latest `main` AGENTS.md update.
- Installed dependencies using npm and generated `package-lock.json`.
- Added explicit ESLint compatibility dependency and `tsx` test runner.
- Replaced deprecated lint command with ESLint CLI.
- Added Prisma schema foundation for all planned MVP entities and enums.
- Added safe environment validation and server-side guard functions.
- Added tests for publishing, paid tool, and upgrade guard defaults and allowed paths.
- Added provider registry types and not-connected provider placeholders.
- Added app shell, route placeholders, mini agent chat, command palette, notifications, and reusable UI components.
- Added documentation for architecture, security, route map, providers, plugins, upgrades, and failure recovery.
- Expanded README setup instructions.
- Added security headers and expanded health route.
- Re-inspected the uploaded template zip and aligned the landing page more closely to its design structure.
- Started next Phase 2 route-specific UI by replacing `/dashboard` with a Folqen-specific dashboard screen.

## Known Broken Areas

No known broken build, lint, typecheck, test, or Prisma schema validation areas.

## Known Mock-Only Areas

- All route data is mock/placeholder.
- All integrations are `Not connected`.
- Mini agent chat is a mock UI shell.
- Command palette and notifications are mock interactions.
- Authentication is not implemented.
- Upload validation is not implemented.
- Database migrations and seed data are not applied.

## Environment Assumptions

- npm is the package manager.
- Local dev database URL is `postgresql://folqen:folqen_password@localhost:5432/folqen?schema=public`.
- Node/npm were provided through a temporary local Node runtime because global npm was not available on PATH.
- The UI should continue using the neon green dark cyber/glass template direction.

## Safe To Continue From Another Account

Yes. The repo is verified and safe to continue from this checkpoint.

## Next Recommended Command

```text
Read root docs and checkpoint docs, run npm install if needed, run lint/typecheck/test/build, then continue Phase 2 route-specific UI refinement. Recommended next routes: `/agent`, `/approvals`, `/platforms`, `/tools`, and `/settings`.
```
